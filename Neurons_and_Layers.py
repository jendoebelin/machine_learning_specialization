# # Optional Lab - Neurons and Layers
# In this lab we will explore the inner workings of neurons/units and layers. In particular, the lab will draw parallels to the models you have mastered in Course 1, the regression/linear model and the logistic model. The lab will introduce Tensorflow and demonstrate how these models are implemented in that framework.

# ## Packages
# **Tensorflow and Keras**  
# Tensorflow is a machine learning package developed by Google. In 2019, Google integrated Keras into Tensorflow and released Tensorflow 2.0. Keras is a framework developed independently by Fran√ßois Chollet that creates a simple, layer-centric interface to Tensorflow. This course will be using the Keras interface.

# ## Neuron without activation - Regression/Linear Model

# ### DataSet
# We'll use an example from Course 1, linear regression on house prices.

# In[3]:


X_train = np.array([[1.0], [2.0]], dtype=np.float32)           #(size in 1000 square feet)
Y_train = np.array([[300.0], [500.0]], dtype=np.float32)       #(price in 1000s of dollars)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)
ax.scatter(X_train, Y_train, marker='x', c='r', label="Data Points")
ax.legend( fontsize='xx-large')
ax.set_ylabel('Price (in 1000s of dollars)', fontsize='xx-large')
ax.set_xlabel('Size (1000 sqft)', fontsize='xx-large')
plt.show()


# ### Regression/Linear Model 
# The function implemented by a neuron with no activation is the same as in Course 1, linear regression:
# $$ f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x^{(i)}) = \mathbf{w}\cdot x^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$
# 
# 

# We can define a layer with one neuron or unit and compare it to the familiar linear regression function.

# In[4]:


linear_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation = 'linear', )


# Let's examine the weights.

# In[5]:


linear_layer.get_weights()


# There are no weights as the weights are not yet instantiated. Let's try the model on one example in `X_train`. This will trigger the instantiation of the weights. Note, the input to the layer must be 2-D, so we'll reshape it.

# In[6]:


a1 = linear_layer(X_train[0].reshape(1,1))
print(a1)


# The result is a tensor (another name for an array) with a shape of (1,1) or one entry.   
# Now let's look at the weights and bias. These weights are randomly initialized to small numbers and the bias defaults to being initialized to zero.

# In[8]:


w, b= linear_layer.get_weights()
print(f"w = {w}, b={b}")


# A linear regression model (1) with a single input feature will have a single weight and bias. This matches the dimensions of our `linear_layer` above.   
# 
# The weights are initialized to random values so let's set them to some known values.

# In[10]:


set_w = np.array([[200]])
set_b = np.array([100])

# set_weights takes a list of numpy arrays
linear_layer.set_weights([set_w, set_b])
print(linear_layer.get_weights())


# Let's compare equation (1) to the layer output.

# In[12]:


a1 = linear_layer(X_train[0].reshape(1,1))
print(a1)
alin = np.dot(set_w,X_train[0].reshape(1,1)) + set_b
print(alin)


# They produce the same values!
# Now, we can use our linear layer to make predictions on our training data.

# In[13]:


prediction_tf = linear_layer(X_train)
prediction_np = np.dot( X_train, set_w) + set_b


# In[14]:


plt_linear(X_train, Y_train, prediction_tf, prediction_np)


# ## Neuron with Sigmoid activation
# The function implemented by a neuron/unit with a sigmoid activation is the same as in Course 1, logistic  regression:
# $$ f_{\mathbf{w},b}(x^{(i)}) = g(\mathbf{w}x^{(i)} + b) \tag{2}$$
# where $$g(x) = sigmoid(x)$$ 
# 
# Let's set $w$ and $b$ to some known values and check the model.
# 

# ### DataSet
# We'll use an example from Course 1, logistic regression.

# In[15]:


X_train = np.array([0., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=np.float32).reshape(-1,1)  # 2-D Matrix
Y_train = np.array([0,  0, 0, 1, 1, 1], dtype=np.float32).reshape(-1,1)  # 2-D Matrix


# In[16]:


pos = Y_train == 1
neg = Y_train == 0
X_train[pos]


# In[22]:


pos = Y_train == 1
neg = Y_train == 0

fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(4,3))
ax.scatter(X_train[pos], Y_train[pos], marker='x', s=80, c = 'red', label="y=1")
ax.scatter(X_train[neg], Y_train[neg], marker='o', s=100, label="y=0", facecolors='none', 
              edgecolors=dlc["dlblue"],lw=3)

ax.set_ylim(-0.08,1.1)
ax.set_ylabel('y', fontsize=12)
ax.set_xlabel('x', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title('one variable plot')
ax.legend(fontsize=12)
plt.show()


# ### Logistic Neuron
# We can implement a 'logistic neuron' by adding a sigmoid activation. The function of the neuron is then described by (2) above.   
# This section will create a Tensorflow Model that contains our logistic layer to demonstrate an alternate method of creating models. Tensorflow is most often used to create multi-layer models. The [Sequential](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/) model is a convenient means of constructing these models.

# In[19]:


model = Sequential(
    [
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_dim=1,  activation = 'sigmoid', name='L1')
    ]
)


# `model.summary()` shows the layers and number of parameters in the model. There is only one layer in this model and that layer has only one unit. The unit has two parameters, $w$ and $b$.

# In[20]:


model.summary()


# In[25]:


logistic_layer = model.get_layer('L1')
w,b = logistic_layer.get_weights()
print(w,b)
print(w.shape,b.shape)


# Let's set the weight and bias to some known values.

# In[26]:


set_w = np.array([[2]])
set_b = np.array([-4.5])
# set_weights takes a list of numpy arrays
logistic_layer.set_weights([set_w, set_b])
print(logistic_layer.get_weights())


# Let's compare equation (2) to the layer output.

# In[27]:


a1 = model.predict(X_train[0].reshape(1,1))
print(a1)
alog = sigmoidnp(np.dot(set_w,X_train[0].reshape(1,1)) + set_b)
print(alog)


# They produce the same values!
# Now, we can use our logistic layer and NumPy model to make predictions on our training data.

# In[28]:


plt_logistic(X_train, Y_train, model, set_w, set_b, pos, neg)


# The shading above reflects the output of the sigmoid which varies from 0 to 1.

# # Congratulations!
# You built a very simple neural network and have explored the similarities of a neuron to the linear and logistic regression from Course 1.
