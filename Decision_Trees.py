# # Ungraded Lab: Decision Trees

# In this notebook you will visualize how a decision tree is splitted using information gain.
# 
# We will revisit the dataset used in the video lectures. The dataset is:

# As you saw in the lectures, in a decision tree, we decide if a node will be split or not by looking at the **information gain** that split would give us. (Image of video IG)
# 
# Where 
# 
# $$\text{Information Gain} = H(p_1^\text{node})- \left(w^{\text{left}}H\left(p_1^\text{left}\right) + w^{\text{right}}H\left(p_1^\text{right}\right)\right),$$
# 
# and $H$ is the entropy, defined as
# 
# $$H(p_1) = -p_1 \text{log}_2(p_1) - (1- p_1) \text{log}_2(1- p_1)$$
# 
# Remember that log here is defined to be in base 2. Run the code block below to see by yourself how the entropy. $H(p)$ behaves while $p$ varies.
# 
# Note that the H attains its higher value when $p = 0.5$. This means that the probability of event is $0.5$. And its minimum value is attained in $p = 0$ and $p = 1$, i.e., the probability of the event happening is totally predictable. Thus, the entropy shows the degree of predictability of an event.

# We will use **one-hot encoding** to encode the categorical features. They will be as follows:
# 
# - Ear Shape: Pointy = 1, Floppy = 0
# - Face Shape: Round = 1, Not Round = 0
# - Whiskers: Present = 1, Absent = 0
# 
# Therefore, we have two sets:
# 
# - `X_train`: for each example, contains 3 features:
#             - Ear Shape (1 if pointy, 0 otherwise)
#             - Face Shape (1 if round, 0 otherwise)
#             - Whiskers (1 if present, 0 otherwise)
#             
# - `y_train`: whether the animal is a cat
#             - 1 if the animal is a cat
#             - 0 otherwise

# On each node, we compute the information gain for each feature, then split the node on the feature with the higher information gain, by comparing the entropy of the node with the weighted entropy in the two splitted nodes. 

# So, the root node has every animal in our dataset. Remember that $p_1^{node}$ is the proportion of positive class (cats) in the root node. So
# 
# $$p_1^{node} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$$

# - $p^{\text{left}}$ and $p^{\text{right}}$, the proportion of cats in **each split**.

# 
# - If the tree depth after splitting exceeds a threshold
# - If the resulting node has only 1 class
# - If the information gain of splitting is below a threshold
